# Red Seed Redemtion Row
(Title to be finalized)

A vampire starts a farm in the wake of thier sire being smote, and through exploring the surrounding wilds and forming relationships with the people of the nearby village will forge thier place in the world.

Currently, the foundations of the deckbuilding combat is in place, which will form the core of the Explore theater. The basics of aging crops, harvesting resources, tool requirements, bare bones inventory are implemented, which should cover enough of Farm to get started and the walk-about-the-area parts of Socialize.

## TODO
Vague and incomplete outline of systems that still need to be refined or put in place.

### Overall

- Calendar/seasonality
- Up game resolution?
